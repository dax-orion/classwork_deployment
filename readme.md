# Classwork on Authentication

A simple website for a company offering cooking classes. Implements simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for subscriber, user, and course entities.

As of the classwork on APIs the page now includes a simple modal that shows an example of AJAX calling an API and displaying the data on a page.

Implements simple login and logout using passport.js.

# Usage

Before you begin, MongoDB should be installed and running on your computer/the server

```
npm install
npm start
```

Note: As of right now, the run script relies on [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) being installed globally, get it with:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```
